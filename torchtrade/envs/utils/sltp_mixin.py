    This mixin provides shared methods for environments that support stop-loss
    and take-profit bracket orders across all exchange environments.

    Required attributes (must be set by the inheriting class):
        - self.position.current_position: int (0=no position, 1=long, -1=short)
        - self.trader: Object with get_status() method
        - self.active_stop_loss: float (current SL price)

        Must be called at the start of each _step() BEFORE the duplicate-action
        guard runs. This ensures self.position.current_position always reflects
        the exchange's actual state, preventing position stacking when bracket
        orders fail but the main order succeeds.

        Args:
            position_status: Position status from trader.get_status(), or None
                if no position exists on the exchange.

        Returns:
            True if a position was closed since the last step (SL/TP trigger
            or external closure), False otherwise.
